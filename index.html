                <p class="lead text-muted">
                    Hello! My name is Kobari Xiong and I am a student at Western Technical College in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. I am currently in the Web and Software Development program at Western 
                    and have been in the program for about a year now. I am always excited to learn about new things especially when it comes to learning languages in programming. I am currently 
                    learning php and sql this semester and I enjoy learning how to use these two together. In the future, I would love to have a career in software engineering where I can express
                    and show my skills through programming.
                </p>

                    I was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin. From a young age, I developed a strong interest in video games, often engaging with them beyond the limits set by my parents. This early 
                    passion sparked a curiosity about the technology behind game development and inspired me to explore how I could transform this interest into a professional career. Technology 
                    has always been an integral part of my life, and currently, as a student in the Web and Software Development program, I am committed to obtaining a software engineering degree 
                    with the goal of pursuing a career as a game developer.
