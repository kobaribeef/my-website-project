            Tuna and salmon are two popular seafood choices and among the most commonly consumed fish in the United States. As such, you may wonder how they compare and whether one is a better 
            choice than the other. This blog looks into these two types of fish to see which one you might consume over the other. First and foremost, both tuna and salmon are dark in color, 
            have a firm texture, and have strong flavors.

                    Tuna is a large, big fish with flesh that ranges from pink to dark red. The color of the fish comes from myoglobin, an oxygen-storing protein found in muscle.
                    Longfin tuna is a popular variety. It has a lighter-colored flesh and midler flavor, and it's usually grilled or seared. Yellowfin tuna is another common variety. 
                    This tuna is often used for sushi, but it can be seared or grilled. This fish is low in fat so it's usually cooked to medium-rare 125°F or 52°C) to retain moisture.
                    Don't overcook it because it can be horribly dry.

                    Salmon ranges from pink to deep reddish-orange. The result of these colors is because of its diet, which consists of krill and tiny crustaceans. These are rich in
                    colorful carotenoids, namely astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is heat stable, which is why salmon retains its red color even when cooked. There are subtle flavor differences
                    between the varieties of salmon, but salmon is usually described as more strongly flavored, oily, or fishy than tuna. Salmon also contains more fat than tuna, which
                    keeps it moist.
