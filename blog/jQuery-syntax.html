            jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to write less JavaScript code while doing more. The reason to use jQuery is because it makes it much easier to use 
            JavaScript on your website. jQuery can take a large amount of ordinary tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to achieve, and wraps them into methods that you can call
            with a single line of code.

        <p>
            The jQuery syntax is customized for selecting HTML elements and performing an action on the elements. Below is an example of the jQuery syntax:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
                // hides the current element
                $(this).hide();
        
                // removes the selected element and its child elements
                $("h1").remove();
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The "$" sign is used to define and access the jQuery. After that, you need a selector inside the parentheses to find HTML elements. Lastly, you can use any action the jQuery has to 
            be performed on the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important thing to know is that you should always put jQuery methods inside a <b>document ready event</b>. This event prevents the jQuery code from running before the document is 
            fully loaded. Waiting for the document to be fully loaded before working with it is always a good idea. Doing this also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your
            document, in the head section. Below is an example of how to use the document ready event:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
                $(document).ready(function(){
        
                    // insert jQuery methods here
                    $("p").hide();
                  
                });
            </code>
        </pre>
        
    </div>
</section>
