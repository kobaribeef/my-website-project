            The Flexible Box Layout Model (Flexbox) is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content. It is excellent at taking a group of items which have different sizes, 
            and gives back the best layout for those items. Flexbox can be useful for creating small-scale layouts and is responsive and mobile-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we start using flexbox to alter a group of items. We'll be using the HTML code below which shows a group of items in a div element for visualization.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-markup">
            <script type="prism-html-markup">
                <div class="container">
                    <div>Item one</div>
                    <div>Item two</div>
                    <div>Item three</div>
                    </div>
            </script>
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            In order to use flexbox, you need to delcare that you are using the flex formatting context and not regular block and inline layout. To use flexbox, change the 
            value of the <b>display</b> property to <b>flex</b>.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-css">
                .container {
                    display: flex;
                    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The group of items in the div element with class "container" will start showing some flexbox behavior and display the items as a row.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wanted to change the direction of your items to display as a column, you could use the <b>flex-direction</b> property. Items are displayed as a row intially 
            because the initial value of <b>flex-direction</b> is a row.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-css">
                .container {
                    display: flex;
                    flex-direction: column;
                    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The group of items will now be displayed as a column since the flex-direction is set to column. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also wrap flex items using the <b>flex-wrap</b> property. The initial value of flex-wrap is set to <b>nowrap</b>. This means that if there is not enough
            space in the contrainer, the items will overflow.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-css">
                .container {
                    display: flex;
                    flex-direction: column;
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
                    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The group of items can now wrap on multiple lines.
        </p>
    </div>
