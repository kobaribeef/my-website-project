        <p>
            The Temporal API is a global Object that acts as a top-level namespace. It brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language. Since the Date API has been a 
            established problem in ECMAScript, the Temporal API was proposed to be a solution for the difficulty of the Date API. The Temporal API fixes these problems by providing practicality
            for date and time computations, first-class support for all time zones, deals only with objects representing fixed dates and times, parsing a strictly specified string format, and
            supporting non-Gregorian calendars. Temporal provides separate ECMAScript classes for date-only, time-only, and other scoped use cases. Code is more readable and prevents bugs 
            caused by incorrectly assuming 0, UTC, or the local time zone for values that are literally unspecified.

        <p>
            Below are some examples of using the Temporal API:
        </p>
        <h4>Temporal.ZonedDateTime</h4>
        <p>
            A Temporal.ZonedDateTime is a timezone-aware, calendar-aware date/time object that represents a real event that has happened at a specific exact time from the outlook of a 
            certain region on Earth. The use of Temporal.ZoneDateTime is to improve the cases that require a time zone.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
                const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({
                  timeZone: 'America/Onalaska',
                  year: 2022,
                  month: 4,
                  day: 19,
                  hour: 6,
                  minute: 31,
                  second: 21,
                  millisecond: 0,
                  microsecond: 3,
                  nanosecond: 500
                }); // => 2022-04-19T06:31:21.0000035-08:00[America/Onalaska]
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h4>Temporal.Calendar</h4>
        <p>
            A Temporal.Calendar represents a calendar system. There are many calendar systems to use but most code will use the ISO 8601 calendar. Dates have associated Temporal.Calendar objects,
            to perform calendar-related math. Beneath all of this, math is done by methods on the calendars.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
                const calendar = Temporal.Calendar.from('iso8601');
                const date = calendar.dateFromFields({ year: 1999, month: 12, day: 31 }, {});
                date.monthsInYear; // => 12
                date.daysInYear; // => 365
            </code>
        </pre>
